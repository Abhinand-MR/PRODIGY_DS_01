# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Task 01 – Bar Chart / Histogram Visualization

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to visualize the distribution of a variable (such as age or gender) using bar charts or histograms. This helps in understanding the data distribution and identifying patterns at a glance.

## 📎 Dataset
For this task, a sample dataset containing population-level attributes like age and gender was used. You can substitute this with any public dataset or synthetic dataset with similar fields.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ⚙️ Task Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values (if any).
   - Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.
   - Selected columns such as `age` (continuous) and `gender` (categorical) for visualization.

3. **Visualization**
   - Created a **bar chart** to show the count of each gender category.
   - Created a **histogram** to display the distribution of age across the population.
   - Customized visualizations with titles, labels, and color themes for clarity.

4. **Insights**
   - Identified which age group was most represented.
   - Detected any imbalance or skew in gender distribution.

## 📊 Output

- 📉 **Histogram:** Age distribution of the population  
- 📊 **Bar Chart:** Gender frequency comparison  
- Each chart includes titles, axis labels, and color enhancements for better presentation.

## ✅ Learnings

- Difference between **bar charts** (for categorical data) and **histograms** (for continuous data).
- Importance of choosing the right visualization type based on variable type.
- Usage of Matplotlib and Seaborn for fast, clean, and informative plots.
- How visualizations can instantly convey patterns and distributions in a dataset.
